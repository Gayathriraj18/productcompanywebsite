            As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market,
            although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.
            The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers,
            including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).
